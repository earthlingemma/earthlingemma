recipe:
  servings: makes 10 to 15 eggs
  prep: 30 min (2 hours wait time)
  
  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 2 cups old fashioned oats
    * 1/4 cup vegan butter
    * 1/3 cup peanut butter
    * 1/4 cup maple syrup
    * 1/4 cup coconut flour 
    * 1 3/4 cups vegan chocolate chips (divided)
    
  directions_markdown:
    1. Add oats to blender or food processer and blend until it becomes a flour-like consistency (I added my chocolate chips (3/4 cup) in at the end and pulsed for a few seconds so they weren't so large).

    2. Melt vegan butter in a small mixing bowl.

    3. Stir in peanut butter and maple syrup.

    4. Add in the oat flour, coconut flour, and 3/4 cup of chocolate chips (if you haven't already)

    5. Roll into egg shapes with your hands and place on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Freeze for at least an hour or until completely hardened.

    6. In a double boiler, melt the remaining one cup of chocolate chips. 

    7. Using two forks, coat each egg completely and return to baking sheet. 

    8. Store in a sealed container in the fridge or freezer.

Is it just me or did Easter kind of creep up on us this year? I suddenly realized it was almost Easter and I had nothing prepared. Of course candy is not the reason for the season, but as we are in the midst of a pandemic and unable to gather with our friends and family, I suddenly felt pressured to make the holiday special in some way. I scrambled to grab some vegan treats at the health food store, but I was pretty unimpressed with the vegan candy selection. Being frugal and innovative and overly confident in my cooking abilities, I decided to make my own chocolate eggs.

They are super simple, requiring only six ingredients, and, in my opinion, the perfect ratio of decadent to wholesome. Although I haven't tested any substitutions, I'm certain you could use a different kind of flour (just adjust the ratio as needed). I used oat flour and the remainder of a bag of coconut flour because it's what I had on hand, but I would guess that almond flour, ground walnuts, or even all-purpose flour would do the trick. You could also try adding in nuts, coconut, mini marshmallows, rice crispies, or whatever you like! Endless possibilities. Enjoy and happy Easter!
