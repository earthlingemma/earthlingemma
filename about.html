	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>Hello and welcome! I'm Emma. I share all kinds of plant-based recipes (healthy and indulgent!) as well as blog posts about health, plant-based living, and more. I am passionate about living a lifestyle centered around compassion, intuition, and nourishment. I advocate for a lifestyle that is sustainable for the individual and the planet. No fad diets, no restrictions, just listening to our bodies and making informed choices.</p>
		
	<p>I transitioned to a vegan diet in 2014. I had always loved experimentng in the kitchen, but I found so much excitement in finding plant-based alternatives for all of my favorite foods. My family and I eat mostly whole food plant-based meals, but we also like to have fun and indulge in some vegan ice cream or oily fries from time to time. I hope for this site to serve as inspiration for those looking to eat more plants or live a livestyle that's gentler on our bodies and the planet. </p>
