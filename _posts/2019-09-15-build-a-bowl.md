When I first went vegan, I had no idea how to create a balanced meal that actually met all of my nutritional needs. Fortunately, I now have kind of a system for creating a balanced meal. Follow along with me as I create a healthy, nourishing Medditeranean-inspired bowl and take the guess work out of creating a filling and nourishing plant-based bowl.

Of course, every bowl will have a different nutritional makeup and that's okay. Depending on the season, the time of the month, the individual, or your mood, no two bowls will be the same. Variety is the spice of life!

I like to start with a big bowl of greens. In the summer, I may use a lighter, crispier lettuce, while on cooler days, I may choose sauteed kale or collards. Eating an adequate amount of greens is so important to our health as they provide so many vital minerals, fiber, iron, and more. Here, I used some mixed baby greens.

Adding a hearty serving of whole grains helps fill me up and provides energy. Carbohydrates are our bodies preferred energy source, so grab a scoop of quinoa, rice, buckwheat, cous cous, or faro to help bulk up your meal and keep your body and brain fueled. Here, I used quinoa.

Next, I add a soure of protein. This doesn't have to be a legume, but legumes are an excellent soure of fiber, iron, protein, and vitamins and minerals. I find when I eat lots of healthy, plant-based protein, I feel more satiated and less likely to resort to chips or chocolate for a snack. Lentils and beans (including tofu and tempeh) are some of the healthiest and cheapest options available, but store-bought meat substitues are still great sources of plant protein when eaten in moderation. If lentils are too hard on your digestion, nuts and seeds are also good protein sources. Today, I used chickpeas that I sauteed with some olive oil, balsamic vinegar, nutritional yeast, salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder.

I then top my bowl with some extra vegetables for flavor, of course, as well as extra nutrients. I love seeing how many colors I can incorporate into my bowl. I topped this bowl with diced cucumber, tomato, and fresh parsley.

Lastly, top with your favorite healthy fats. Fats are so important for your skin, liver, and digestion. I love adding avocado, cashew cheese, nut-butter sauces, pepitas, or hemp seeds. On this bowl, I used a lemon tahini garlic sauce and some homemade vegan feta (You can find the feta recipe here***)

Bonus points if you top your bowl with dulse (high in iodine), nutritional yeast (high in b12), or extra herbs. I usually implement this method for my other meals too, like pizza, baked potatoes, burritos, etc. What kind of bowl are you going to try?
