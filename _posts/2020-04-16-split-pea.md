Need an easy, cozy, mid-week dinner? The good old split pea soup gets an upgrade with miso and (*gasp*) carrot tops! Ok confession: I hate veggie broth. I know it has its uses, but I don't like having big cartons in my fridge and honestly, I think it makes all soups kind of taste the same. I often swap it out for miso! I keep a big tub of miso in my fridge to add to all sorts of savory dishes and it lasts me quite a while. It does have a pretty strong flavor that not every dish can handle so gracefully, but I think split peas and miso are wonderfully compatible star-crossed lovers who complement each other perfectly! And carrot tops--these tender little greens are often overlooked, but are perfect for pesto, sauces, or soups such as this. I'm all about getting my money's worth from my ingredients, especially while in the midst of a pandemic!

This soup is just as flavorful as it is nutritious. I made shiitake bacon (recipe is from the cookbook Mississippi Vegan), which I would argue is essential to the soup, although I'm sure another type of vegan bacon or ham would also be delicious. A drizzle of coconut milk, olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper are the perfect finishing touches. I even added spirulina the second day to boost the nutrients a little bit and it was perfect! Hope this soup keeps you full, warm, and cozy!
