  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 3-5 kale leaves
    * 1 cup liquid (coconut water, water, plant milk, or whatever you like)
    * 2 frozen bananas
    * 1 mango (frozen or fresh)
    * 1/2 cup pineapple or other sweet fruit (optional)
    * 1 tsp spirulina

    * 1/2 lime, juiced

    1. Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend, blend, blend!

    ## Tips:
    * A good blender makes all the difference for blending kale. If your blender is dull or low power, you're going to end up with a smoothie that requires a little chewing.
    * Sweeten it up! I embrace the green taste in my smoothies, but if the flavor is too overpowering, try adding a couple of dates or some extra sweet fruit like pineapple or peaches.
    * Take the opportunity to pack in the superfoods. I love putting so many "superfoods" in my breakfast that I'm set for the day. Try adding some medicinal mushrooms, dried herb powder, fresh herbs, ginger, turmeric, or whatever you fancy for an added punch.

There's just something about green smoothies that makes me feel like a glowing health goddess. Anyone else? Let me share with you my favorite green smoothie recipe, as well as some tips on how to up your smoothie game.

Green smoothies have a bit of a reputation with vegans...and for good reason! Kale and spirulina are the stars of this show and what gives my smoothies their beautiful green hue. Dark leafy greens are amazing sources of Vitamins A, K, C, calcium, folate, and so much more. So many of us are deficient in vital nutrients because we skimp out on fresh produce. Your body will thank you for adding that extra bit of green to your breakfast.

Spirulina is a type of fresh water algae, rich in vitamins A,K, B12, and iron. It is incredibly nutrient dense and a complete protein. If you have access to this nutrient powerhouse, you should definitely be taking it.

Chia seeds are another important component. Packed with omegas, protein, iron, fiber, and so much more, these friendly little seeds are amazing, nourishing building blocks for our bodies. Hemp and flax are also great alternatives. I love to mix them up.

Blend all those ingredients up with delicious, fresh, vitamin and mineral-rich fruit and voila! The perfect start to your morning.
