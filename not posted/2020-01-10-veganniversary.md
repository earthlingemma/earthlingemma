Recently, my sister and I celebrated 5 years of veganism. And since we love finding an occasion to make bomb vegan food, we took this opportunity to try some new things...and I have to say, it all came out so good! If you find yourself entertaining and need some party food ideas, give some of these a try. We even tested them on a couple of non-vegans and they loved it all! I am going to write out the details for each of the dishes we made so you can try them all out!


## Garlic and Herb Vegan Cheese

After scouring the internet for vegan brie recipes, we decided on [this cheese recipe](https://minimalistbaker.com/garlic-herb-vegan-cheese/) from Minimalist Baker instead. I was drawn to this recipe because it doesn't require any "weird" or hard to find ingredients (where the heck do you get agar?). It's cashew based and requires only ten ingredients. It does, however, need to set in the fridge for at least six hours, if you try it, be sure to give yourself plenty of time. 

This cheese was a hit. We served it with a fresh baguette. I did feel like the cheese lacked that sharpness that cheese has, so next time, I will add a little extra lemon and maybe some apple cider vinegar or mustard. The texture was very soft, but it held its form nicely. I would also consider using refined coconut oil to give it a little extra firmness. All in all, I would highly recommend this recipe. I think it's comparable in flavor to a lot of store-bought vegan cheese spreads and much cheaper. 

## Vegan Clam Chowder

My sister chose this recipe, which, if you grew up with her, like I did, will not surprise you. You see, my sister is a bit of a clam chowder conoisseur. Having grown up in Rhode Island, her go-to order when we went out to dinner was always clam chowder and fries. So it was only a matter of time before we attempted a vegan version. We used [this Vegan "Clam" Chowder recipe](https://www.forkandbeans.com/2014/05/10/vegan-clam-chowder/) from Fork and Beans, which uses shiitake mushrooms as the clams. It was so good! Seriously, SO flavorful, hearty, and comforting. Our only complaint here was that there should have been more "clams" and we even added more than it called for. We will definitely be making it again!

## Asian Tempeh Salad

I was inspired to make this salad after a eating a similar tempeh salad I had at an all vegan Thai restaurant in Portland, OR. I guess I should have written down what was in it, because I ended up guessing and it did not really taste like the original, but we still liked it. I did not measure or follow a recipe here, but I will give you the gist of it. For the tempeh, I whisked together some apricot ginger jam, soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, onion powder, ginger powder, and olive oil. I marinated them for about an hour. Then I fried them up in a generous amount of oil. The base of the salad was just spinach and spring mix, julienned rainbow carrots, julienned cucumbers, and cilantro. I mixed in the tempeh and topped it with red onion. The dressing was pretty much the same as the marinade, which was perfectly spicy and so delicious. The one mistake in this dish, was that I added the tempeh while it was still very hot, which wilted all the lettuce. In my head, it was going to be a lovely misture of hot and cold, but I would definitely recommend letting the tempeh cool before adding it.

## Loaded Baked Potato Pizza

As a carb lover, I feel like there's nothing better than potatoes on pizza, so we got this idea to do a loaded baked potato style pizza, with all the topping you would normally put on a baked potato: cheese, sour cream, broccoli, and bacon. I typed out the recipe [here]. This is definitely one of my favorite pizzas I've ever made (do I say that every time I make pizza? Maybe). Sadly, the best part was the shiitake bacon, which I burnt. We salvaged a few pieces, but I wish there was more. Well, next time (and there will be a next time), I'm loading it up with shiitake bacon.

Last but definitely not least, dessert! We made vegan twix bars to wrap up our celebration. We used a recipe from Flora and Vino, which can be found [here](https://www.floraandvino.com/raw-vegan-twix-bars/).
