  ingredients_markdown: |-
    ### For Cookie:
    * 1 cup old fashioned oats
    * 1/3 cup almond flour
    * 1/4 tsp baking soda
    * pinch of salt
    * 3 tbsp coconut oil (softened)
    * 2 tbsp maple syrup
    * 1/4 tsp vanilla

    ### For Peanut Butter Center:
    * 1/4 cup peanut butter
    * 1 tbsp maple syrup
    * 2 tsp coconut oil


    ### For Chocolate Coating:
    * 2/3 cup vegan chocolate chips (I used Lily's Dark Chocolate Chips)
    * 1 tbsp peanut butter
    * small amount of coconut oil if necessary (to make chocolate thinner)
    
  directions_markdown:
    1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
    
    2. Combine dry ingredients in a food processor or blender and blend until a coarse flour is formed.

    3. Transfer to a mixing bowl and add coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla.

    4. Roll out the dough between two pieces of parchment paper. It should be about 1/4 of an inch thick.

    5. Using a small, round cookie cutter (I used a small jar), cut out circular cookies and place on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet.
    
    6. Bake for about 10 minutes or until the edges start to turn golden. Allow to cool for at least 30 minutes or in the freezer for about 15.
    
    7. In a double boiler (or large glass bowl placed on pot of boiling water), combine peanut butter, maple syrup, and coconut oil until melted and creamy.

    8. One by one, dip the top side of each cookie in the peanut butter mixture and twist them around so that a generous amount sticks to each. Repeat until all are covered with the peanut butter layer. Don't wash your double boiler!

    9. Place in freezer for about 30 minutes or until peanut butter mixture is frozen.

    10. In your double boiler, that should have some peanut butter remains inside, add vegan chocolate and melt. Stir in peanut butter and, if too thick, a little coconut oil. 

    11. Remove your cookies from the freezer and dunk the cookies into the chocolate mixture. I found it easiest to dunk them peanut butter side down, freeze, and then dip the bottoms, scraping off the excess chocolate.
    
    12. Return to the freezer until chocolate is solid (about 15 min). Enjoy frozen or at room temp!

I was walking into the grocery store the other day when the familiar sight of Girl Scouts around a fold-up table topped with colorful boxes caught my eye. My heart rate increased as I neared their set up, quickly thinking up an excuse not to buy their cookies. As a former Girl Scout, I know all too well that those girls don't easily take no for an answer! I slipped into the store unnoticed, but on my way out, I nearly fell victim to their genius marketing scheme (of doing nothing at all. Let's be real. The cookies sell themselves). But as I eyed the selection of cookies on the table, four words changed my mind. "Five dollars a box!"

$5?? I mean, I get it. Inflation and what not, but ya girl is cheap and likes to bake so it was time for another baking project. Last year, I made a vegan and gluten-free samoa, one of my favorite cookies! I asked my instagram followers, who, fortunately, voted for the same thing I wanted: TAGALONGS! And so they were born. Crunchy oat and almond flour cookies topped with a slightly sweet peanut butter mixture and rich, dark chocolate. The perfect salty-sweet combo if you ask me. I'm im love. They're not the prettiest, you guys, but they're darn good. I hope you love them too!
