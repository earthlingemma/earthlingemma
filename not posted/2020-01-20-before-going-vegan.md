So you're thinking of going vegan? That's amazing. Whether you're in it for your health, the animals, or the environment, just the fact that you are analyzing your lifestyle and the effects your decisions have is laudable. Congrats! Now before you go rogue, here are five things that I wish I knew before I went vegan. Maybe they wil help you too. 

## 1. You need to eat more

It's true! Plants are much less calorie-dense than animal-based foods. Don't expect to just eliminate the meat and dairy and expect to feel okay. You're going to have to up your portions sizes, as well as the amount of legumes and nuts and seeds you eat. For example, if you would typically eat a chicken burrito, swap the meat for a hearty scoop of black beans and the cheese for homemade cashew cheese or guacamole. Listen to your body and eat when you are hungry. If you have cravings, you probably haven't eaten enough.

## 2. You need to supplement

Because of the world we live in today, supplements are important to our health. At a minumim, you will need to take B12, but lots of vegans also consume D3 and DHA/EPA to be safe.

B12 is produced by bacteria found in the soil. It can be obtained by eating slightly dirty vegetables or drinking water from the earth, but most of us are probably content eating our washed veggies and filtered water. Grass-fed livestock obtain B12 from eating a little dirt with their grass, but most animals raised for food are given B12 supplements. 

Dairy is also typically fortified with Vitamin D3 so you may want to include that as well. Vitamin D, of course, comes from the sun, but many of us, even those of us who live in tropical climates, are still deficient, so supplementing might be a good idea. 

Some vegans also choose to supplement with DHA/EPA, which are long-chain Omega 3s that are found in algae. Our bodies can assemble these long-chain omega 3s from ALA, but that process isn't always 100% efficient. 

I personally take a combination of these three nutrients from a company called Complement (I'll link the website here) and I'm quite happy with them. Again, listen to your body. Going vegan is a big adjustment and it may take you a while to make sure that you are meeting your nutritional needs. It may help at first to use an app like Cronometer, which tracks your nutrients, or get tested to see if you are deficient in any major nutrients.

## 3. No one really cares what you eat

When I first transitioned to a vegan diet, I was very nervous about how people would react. Some people did give me a hard time, but most were really cool about it. I thought people would be way more judgmental than they were. Sure I got interrogated at Thanksgiving at first and every person who found out would ask about protein and if I missed bacon, but I actually found that nobody cared as much as I thought they would. I can say with 100% certainty that I didn't lose any friends from going vegan. If anything, joining the vegan community helped me make more friends! To my surprise, lots of my friends transitioned to veganism or started eating a lot more plants without me even trying to change them! 

## 4. It's okay if you can't be 100% vegan right away

Being vegan is amazing, but it's okay if you take your time with the transition. It's better to transition slowly than to shock your body and end up reverting back to your old diet. Even if you never become fully vegan, every little change makes a difference. Meatless Mondays are great. Vegetarianism is great. Simply, do what you can. Being vegan is a privilege. Although vegan diets can be extrememly beneficial for your health, various health ailments will not allow people to be exclusively plant-based. Veganism can also be extremely cheap, but for people living in poverty, who are struggling to get enough food to survive, turning down non-vegan food is not an option. No one is perfect. Unfortunately, in the world we live in, it's impossible to completely abstain from environmentally-damaging activities, but it's putting in the effort and learning to become a conscious consumer that is going to help make the world a better place, not perfectionism.

## 5. Go easy on your friends and family

When you first go vegan and you're full of passion and new information, it can be really hard not to become a "pushy vegan." Your friends and family continue to eat the same animal products while you're dying to tell them their bacon causes cancer and their cheese is fermented breast milk meant for a cow's stolen baby. I've been there. I was a pushy vegan for much longer than I am proud to admit (mostly with my family) and let me tell you; it doesn't work. It just makes the other person feel defensive and will most likely push them away from veganism. It's great to share helpful information in a kind and respectful way, but avoid attacking the other person. Instead, lead by example and bring them lots of delicious vegan food to help them come around in their own time. Remember that we all used to be in their shoes.
