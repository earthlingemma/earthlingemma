I decided this year was the year I couldn't live without another Samoa. These cookies have that nostalgic toasted coconut flavor and are sweetened with dates and maple syrup. Filled with creamy almond butter and free from refined sugar, animal products, and hydrogenated oils, these tasty little cookies are the perfect treat for any time of the day.

You know when recipes just work? That's what happened with this one. I honestly didn't expect them to be so irresistable on the first try (I'm talking eat-the-whole-batch-in-a-day-irresistable) considering they're gluten-free, butter-free, and refined sugar-free.

The shortbread cookies are absolutely delicious on their own. They're buttery, coconutty, and just slightly sweet. It's the gluten-free shortbread cookie I never knew I needed. Topped with the almond butter-caramel layer and dark chocolate drizzle, they're everything dreams are made of.
