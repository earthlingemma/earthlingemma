	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>Hello and welcome! I'm Emma. I share all kinds of plant-based recipes (healthy and indulgent!) as well as blog posts about health, plant-based living, and more. I am passionate about living a lifestyle centered around compassion, intuition, and nourishment. I advocate for a way of living that is sustainable for the individual and the planet. No fad diets, no restrictions, just listening to our bodies and making informed choices.</p>

	<p>I transitioned to a vegan diet in 2014 - you can read more about my vegan journey 
	<a href="{% link _posts/2019-09-02-vegan-journey.md %}">here</a>. I had always loved experimentng in the kitchen, but I fell in love with the challenge of finding plant-based alternatives for all of my favorite foods. My family and I eat mostly whole food plant-based meals, but we also like to have fun and indulge in some vegan ice cream or french fries from time to time. I hope this site serves as inspiration for those looking to eat more plants or live a livestyle that's gentler on our bodies and the planet. </p>
