So you're thinking of going vegan? That's amazing. Whether you're in it for your health, the animals, or the environment, just the fact that you are analyzing your lifestyle and the effects your decisions have is laudable. Congrats! Now before you go rogue, here are five things that I wish I knew before I went vegan. Maybe they wil help you too. 

## 1. You need to eat more

It's true! Plants are much less calorie-dense than animal-based foods. Don't expect to just eliminate the meat and dairy and expect to feel okay. You're going to have to up your portions sizes, as well as the amount of legumes and nuts and seeds you eat. For example, if you would typically eat a chicken burrito, swap the meat for a hearty scoop of black beans and the cheese for homemade cashew cheese or guacamole. Listen to your body and eat when you are hungry. If you have cravings, you probably haven't eaten enough.

## 2. You need to supplement

Because of the world we live in today, supplements are important to our health. At a minumim, you will need to take B12, but lots of vegans also consume D3 and DHA/EPA to be safe.

B12 is produced by bacteria found in the soil. It can be obtained by eating slightly dirty vegetables or drinking water from the earth, but most of us are probably content eating our washed veggies and filtered water. Grass-fed livestock obtain B12 from eating a little dirt with their grass, but most animals raised for food are given B12 supplements. 

Dairy is also typically fortified with Vitamin D3 so you may want to include that as well. Vitamin D, of course, comes from the sun, but many of us, even those of us who live in tropical climates, are still deficient, so supplementing might be a good idea. 

Some vegans also choose to supplement with DHA/EPA, which are long-chain Omega 3s that are found in algae. Our bodies can assemble these long-chain omega 3s from ALA, but that process isn't always 100% efficient. 

I personally take a combination of these three nutrients from a company called Complement (I'll link the website here) and I'm quite happy with them. Again, listen to your body. Going vegan is a big adjustment and it may take you a while to make sure that you are meeting your nutritional needs. It may help at first to use an app like Cronometer, which tracks your nutrients, or get tested to see if you are deficient in any major nutrients.

## 3. People are going to give you a hard time  (but maybe not as much as you think)

When I first transitioned to a vegan diet, I was very nervous about how people would react. Some people did give a hard time, but most were really cool about it. I thought people would be way more judgmental than they were. Sure I got interrogated at Thanksgiving at first and every person who found out would ask about protein and if I missed bacon, but I actually found that nobody cared as much as I thought they would. Actually, with time, lots of my friends also became vegan or started eating a lot more plants without me even trying to change them!

## 4. It's okay if you can't be 100% vegan right away

Being vegan is amazing, but it's okay if you take your time with the transition. It's better to transition slowly than to shock your body and end up reverting back to your old diet. Even if you never become fully vegan, every little change makes a difference. Meatless Mondays are great. Vegetarianism is great. Simply, do what you can. Being vegan is a privilege. Although vegan diets can be extrememly beneficial for your health, various health ailments will not allow people to be exclusively plant-based. Veganism can also be extremely cheap, but for people living in poverty, who are struggling to get enough food to survive, turning down non-vegan food is not an option. No one is perfect. Unfortunately, we all do things that have negative consequences on the environment. It's putting in the effort and learning to become a conscious consumer that is going to help make the world a better place, not perfectionism.
