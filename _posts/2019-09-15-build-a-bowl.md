When I first went vegan, I had no idea how to create a balanced meal that actually met all of my nutritional needs. By sharing this simple method I use, hopefully you can take the guess work out of creating a healthy and nourishing vegan meal.

Of course, every bowl will have different ratios of macronutrients and that's okay! Depending on the season, the time of the month, the individual, or your mood, no two bowls will be the same. Variety is the spice of life! 

Typically, I like to start with a green and a grain. In the summer, I may use a lighter, crispier lettuce, while on cooler days, I may choose sauteed kale or collards. Eating an adequate amount of greens is so important to our health as they provide so many vital minerals, fiber, iron, and more. Adding a hearty serving of whole grains helps fill me up and provides energy. Carbohydrates are our bodies preferred energy source, so grab a scoop of quinoa, rice, buckwheat, cous cous, or faro to help bulk up your meal and keep your body and brain fueled.

Next, I add a soure of protein. This doesn't have to be a legume, but legumes are an excellent soure of fiber, iron, protein, and vitamins and minerals. I find when I eat lots of healthy, plant-based protein, I feel more satiated and less likely to resort to chips or chocolate for a snack. Lentils and beans (including tofu and tempeh) are some of the healthiest and cheapest options available, but store-bought meat substitues are still great sources of plant protein when eaten in moderation.

I then top my bowl with some extra vegetables for flavor, of course, as well as extra nutrients. I love seeing how many colors I can incorporate into my bowl.

Lastly, top with your favorite healthy fats. Fats are so important for your skin, liver, and digestion. I love adding avocado, cashew-based sauces, pepitas, or hemp seeds.
