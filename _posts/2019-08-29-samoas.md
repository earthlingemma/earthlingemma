    1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
    2. Combine oats and coconut in a food processor and pulse until you have a coarse flour.
    3. Mix in baking soda and salt.
    4. Mix in coconut oil and maple syrup, then combine with hands until it forms a sticky dough (if it seems too dry, add a splash of plant milk until it sticks).
    5. Place parchment paper on a surface and place dough on top. Cover with another sheet of parchment paper and roll dough with a rolling pin. 
    6. Use a circular cookie cutter to make cookies. Use a metal straw to poke holes (optional).
    7. Bake at 325 degrees for 17 to 20 minutes.
    7. Combine almond butter, dates, coconut oil, maple syrup, and coconut cream in food processor and blend until sooth.
    8. Toast coconut over medium-low on stove top.
    9. Stir 3/4 of toasted cocont into almond butter mixture.
    10. Once cookies have cooled, spoon the mixture on top, then roll in the remaining toasted coconut. Repeat with all cookies.
    11. In a double boiler, combine finely chopped cacao butter, cacao powder, and maple syrup (or melt chocolate chips)
    12. Dip the bottom of each cookie in chocolate and place on parchment paper. Then drizzle remaining chocolate on top.

I decided this year was the year I couldn't live without another Samoa. These cookies have that nostalgic toasted coconut flavor and are sweetened with dates and maple syrup. I think they are better than the originals because they're filled with creamy almond butter and have no refined sugar, animal products, or hydrogenated oils.
