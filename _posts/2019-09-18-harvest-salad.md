    1. Combine all of the ingredients for the feta in a blender and puree until extremely smooth. You may need to stop, scrape down the sides and blend some more a few times.

    2. Once completely smooth, place your soft mixture into a container or appropriately shaped mold and seal with a cover. Place in fridge until firm.
    
    3. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

    4. Toss chopped sweet potato in melted coconut oil, curry powder, and salt.

    5. Cook for approximately 20 minutes or until soft.

    6. Place greens in a salad bowl. Top with sweet potato, and pomegranate seeds, and pepitas.

    7. In a small bowl, mix the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, and curry powder to make dressing.
    
    8. Top salad with dressing and vegan feta and enjoy!

Early fall is known as the season of bountiful harvest. Time to raid your farmers market for ripe, end of season fruits and veggies! In this salad, pomegranates, sweet potato, and pepitas come together over a bed of dark greens. Topped with a warming curry vinaigrette and tangy homemade feta, this fall-inspired salad is the perfect dish for those last few summery days or the cool and crisp weather of autumn.

The sweetness of the sweet potato and pomegranate contrast so nicely with curry spices and feta. I got the feta recipe from [Erin Ireland's website](http://itstodiefor.ca/the-best-tofu-feta-ever-hands-down/) and she got it from Virtuous Pie, which happens to be one of my favorite vegan restaurants in Portland, OR. I was sold before I even tried it, but MY GOD, this cheese is good. It seriously rivals the real thing. I even used unrefined coconut oil, which gives it a slight coconut taste, but I didn't mind at all.

Give this salad a try and let me know what you think! I think crispy roasted brussel sprouts, a nice slice of toasted sourdough bread, or a warm bed of quinoa would be the perfect addition to take this salad into the cooler months.
