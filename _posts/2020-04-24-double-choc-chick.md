recipe:
  servings: 8 to 10 cookies
  prep: 15 min
  cook: 20 min
  
  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 1 can (15 ounces) chickpeas, drained
    * 1/3 cup peanut butter
    * 1 tbsp melted coconut oil
    * 1/3 cup pure maple syrup
    * 1 teaspoon vanilla
    * 2 heaping tbsp cocoa powder
    * 1/2 tsp salt
    * 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
    * 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
    * 1/4 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
    * 1/3 cup vegan chocolate chips, plus a few more for on top
    * Coarse sea salt, for sprinkling

    
  directions_markdown:
    1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
    
    2. In a blender or food processor, combine all ingredients except coconut and chocolate chips. Blend until smooth.

    3. Stir in your coconut and chocolate chips.
    
    3. Using a tablespoon, drop balls of dough onto a parchment paper lined cookie sheet. The dough will be wetter than regular cookie dough (almost like really thick panckes). Don't be alarmed! It's gonna work out.

    4. Using a fork. Lightly press down on each cookie, so it's kind of a flattened ball shap. These won't melt down as much as other cookies so it's best to flatten them a bit beforehand.

    4. Add a few more chocolate chips and coconut on top if desired.

    5. Bake in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes. They may seem a little mushy still, but they will firm up as they cool.

    6. While still hot, sprinkle with coarse sea salt if desired.

    7. Let cool for about 10 minutes before digging in.

They're fudgy. They're delicious. They're...made of chickpeas? That's right, friends. We're putting chickpeas in our desserts, now. We should have been doing this all along! I'm normally pretty skeptical of healthy desserts (desserts are desserts! They don't need to be healthy), but these little grain-free, protein packed chocolate bombs deserve a spot on the blog. Double chocolate cookies have been my favorite cookie forever. So after making a few batches of [Ambitious Kitchen's Chickpea Blondie recipe](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/flourless-chocolate-chip-chickpea-blondies-with-sea-salt-vegan-gluten-free-healthy/), I thought, what am I doing? I could be making these chocolatey-er. So after a few adaptations, these cookies were born. And I love them.

It all starts with a can of chickpeas. The original recipe says to rinse, but I just drain. I've tried both and I actually think that little bit of aquafaba (chickpea water) that remains on the chickpeas helps fluff them up. Up to you. Blend with the other ingredients, mix in coconut shreds and your favorite chocolate chips, and you've got a dangerous combo. Try not to eat it all before baking. Or do if that's what suits your fancy. I haven't tried these, but I think oats, walnuts, or almonds would also make great ingredients. Make sure you resist the urge to overcook these cookies, as they will turn out dry. Enjoy with a glass of your favorite dairy-free milk!
