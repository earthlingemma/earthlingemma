Recently I had my first mocktail since I was...hmm...maybe 13 years old? After having this mocktail at a restaurant, I fell in love and knew I had to recreate it. I'm a sucker for all things ginger...and turmeric and lime and it just so happens those are the ingredients of this sweet and spicy mocktail. Enjoy this simple delight as is or add a splash of your favorite liquor.

(The restaurant was Blossoming Lotus in Portland, OR. They are an entirely plant-based restaurant and we had some of the best food of our trip there. We got nachos, crispy potatoes, a caesar salad, and a chocolate chip cookie.)
